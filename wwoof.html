        <h2> About</h2>
        <p> WWOOF stands for <strong> World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms </strong> <br></br>

WWOOF is a worldwide movement linking volunteers with organic farmers and growers to promote cultural and educational experiences based on trust and non-monetary exchange, thereby helping to build a sustainable, global community.

As a volunteer (or WWOOFer as we call them) you will live alongside your host helping with daily tasks and experiencing life as a farmer.

As a host farm you will open your home to receive visitors from your own country or abroad who want to connect with the land and support the organic movement.</p>

        <h2> WWOOF FAQs</h2>
         <h3> Why WWOOF? </h3>
<p> WWOOF specialises in linking people who are passionate about healthy food, healthy living and a healthy planet. Join us, show your support for the organic movement and start learning (or sharing) ways of living a more sustainable life. As a member you will be plugged into an international network of like-minded people, with staff on the ground in 60+ countries ready to offer local advice and support. </p>

<h3> How do I start WWOOFing? </h3>
<p> First you need to decide where in the world you want to go! You can see the complete list of destinations on the locations page. Sign up as a volunteer on the WWOOF and then you can start contacting hosts to arrange your visit. If you want to visit more than one country you will need to sign up as a volunteer in each country you plan to visit. Also, you are responsible for ​obtaining your Visa and paying for ​your own transportation & personal expenses. We do not make arrangements for you, instead you will make contact with the hosts yourself. </p>
